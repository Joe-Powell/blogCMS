			TO COMMIT,wq
					git commit  cant type anymore so click i to go into insert mode
					you must enter a commit message first not commented out to commit 
					you can remove a # comment if you want
					then you can type to get OUT hit esc :wq then enter 
					
					WHEN COMMITING YOU CAN SKIP THE EDIT STAGE in git bash by typing 
						git commit -m 'this is the message'  then enter  this will add the message
						since it must have a message...
					
					so thats how you create a commit to master. any changes you make
					after that and save it, it wont be saved to master unless you commit it.
					even though its changes, its not in git master. 
					when you git add, your adding it to the staging area, then you can
					commit after that.... so first add to staging then add to master after that....
					
					
				
				make files that wont get added to staging .gitignore     traversey 18:10
					touch .gitignore, you cant create in the explorer directory, use cmd or bash
					a file wont get added to the staging area when filename is inside gitignore file 
					for example when you when you git add . // adds all to staging
					touch .gitignore cant create in directory use cmd or bash
					then git add . and youll see that whatever files you type inside will not get staged
					so this is for files we dont want to include into our repository in the staging area that is...
					to put whole folder put folder name 
					if you put *.txt it will  get all .txtfiles
					
					
			BRANCHES  
					git branch branchname   to create then checkout
					git checkout branchname to get into a branch
					git checkout master back to master..
			
			MERGE
					while in the master branch
					git merge branchname
					press i then add a message then uncommented
					esc :wq  enter
			
			Repository into github
					dont forget to git init first in the computer folder
					so go to github.com, make new repository in hub first, copy and past into the 
					commandline 
					this aint perfect, instructions in the github thingie once you create repo...
					*	git remote add origin https://github.com/Joe-Powell/new.git
					*   git push -u origin master
					* enter uname/password prompt
					then everytime you make changes, youll first 
					*git add .
					 then git commit -m 'added changes' in bash..
						command line message, then esc then :wq    
					 now its added to local computer
					 we havent actually pushed it yet so..
					 then git push 	then it will push right to github
					
			TO CLONE   this is an easy way to clone without having to download a zip
				create folder, open with bash so right click on empty folder then in comand
				line type git clone then paste in clone url inside the code of repository

					or if  someone sends changes to your github repo and you pulll it in
